# JavaScript, Understanding the Weird Parts

#### Introduction

Understand the programming language, don't just copy code

JavaScript has its own mode and design decisions, it's not necessarily like the programming languages it might resemble

It's not enough to know JS frameworks; it's important to know vanilla JS

#### Syntax Parsers

"A program that reads your code and determines what it does and if its grammar (syntax) is valid" 

Compilers, Interpreters

Sometimes syntax parsers will translate your intent in a different way than what you expected

#### Execution Contexts

"A wrapper to help manage the code that is running"

It can contain things beyond what is written in the code.

#### Lexical Environments

"Where something sits physically in the code you write"

Syntax parsers care about the placement of your code. Order matters.

#### Name/Value Pairs and Objects

"A name which maps to a unique value"

The name can be defined more than once, but only can have one value in any given context.

The value can be more name/value pairs

Object: A collection of name/value pairs (JavaScript)

It's just that simple.
